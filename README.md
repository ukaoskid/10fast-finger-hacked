# 10 Fast Fingers - Hacked (in Javascript)

10 Fast Fingers (https://10fastfingers.com/) is a website where you can challenge your own abilities (and others abilities) in fast typing with your keyboard. I tried it and I became addicted to it ignoring the reason why. Everyday I do my typing run. As a developer, I can say that it may be a good warming up exercise for your fingers before starting to work!

I am not really a Javascript professional, but I can have fun with it, moreover, if this time I can get the help of my dear friend and "code-pal" Alessandro Mitelli (https://github.com/alesmit). He hacked for first this cute game.

### Instruction for use

1. Modify the variable `resultYouWant` typing your desired result;
2. Copy the whole code;
3. Open the `Developer Tools` in Chrome by pressing `CTRL + Shift + J`;
4. Paste it in the `console`
5. Press `ENTER` and enjoy your result in total lazyness.
